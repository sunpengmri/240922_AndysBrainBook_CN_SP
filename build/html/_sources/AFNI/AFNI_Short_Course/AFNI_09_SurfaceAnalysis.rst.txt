AFNI Tutorial #9: Surface-Based Analysis with SUMA
==================================================

Our analyses so far have been **volume-based** - that is, we have preprocessed and calculated statistics for each voxel of a three-dimensional cube. Our goal in this chapter is to do the preprocessing and statistical modeling on a two-dimensional **surface** of the cortex. This gives you several advantages, including:

1. The ability to visualize activity along the surfaces of the gyri and sulci, which gives you a better picture of where the activity is localized;
2. This also avoids the :ref:`partial voluming problem <FS_01_BasicTerms>` of a voxel that encompasses the edges of multiple gyri, making it impossible to determine which part of the cortex the activity comes from;
3. The ability to use larger smoothing kernels to increase your signal-to-noise ratio.

We will run this analysis with **SUMA**, a package that comes with your AFNI installation. Technically, SUMA is a separate package that can be run on its own, but we will be using it in conjunction with the AFNI viewer and with AFNI commands.

Before going on, review the :ref:`FreeSurfer tutorials <FreeSurfer_Introduction>` to make sure you have FreeSurfer installed. You will also want to install the command :ref:`parallel <FS_04_ReconAllParallel>` to speed up your analysis.
