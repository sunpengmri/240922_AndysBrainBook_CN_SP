Machine Learning Tutorial #7: Group Analysis
============================================

---------------

Overview
********

As in our tutorials on fMRI analysis, our goal in analyzing this dataset is to generalize the results to the population that the sample was drawn from. In other words, if we see a significant classification accuracy in these subjects, can we say that it would likely be seen in the population as well?

With MVPA, we have two different types of group analysis we can do: One with the ROI results, and one with the searchlight results. We will review how to do each of these in turn.


Group Analysis: ROI
*******************

One of the first-level analyses we did was a classification analysis within a region of interest, or ROI. In this case, we used the masks created in the original Haxby study, and generated a single classification accuracy for each condition for each subject. When we scripted our analyses in the last chapter, these results were stored in the directory ``ROI_Results``; in order to do a group analysis, we will need to extract the classification accuracy for the conditions we are interested in, and then compare the accuracy across conditions.

.. Future chapter topic: Comparing these results to a control ROI in another region, or outside the brain

The code below will extract the classification accuracy and store them in variables. For example, the cell ``(4,4)`` indexes the classification accuracy for "Faces", since that was the fourth condition that we entered in our list of labelnames for the classifier:

::

  %%% Define the variables

  subjects = [1 2 3 4 5 6];
  Group_Results_Face = [];
  Group_Results_House = [];
  Group_Results_Scissors = [];

  %%% Extract confusion matrix accuracy for Faces, Houses, and Scissors

  for subject=subjects

      subject = num2str(subject);

      ROI_Results = load([pwd '/SPM_Results_' subject '/ROI_Results/res_confusion_matrix.mat']);

      Group_Results_Face = [Group_Results_Face, ROI_Results.results.confusion_matrix.output{1}(4,4)];
      Group_Results_House = [Group_Results_House, ROI_Results.results.confusion_matrix.output{1}(5,5)];
      Group_Results_Scissors = [Group_Results_Scissors, ROI_Results.results.confusion_matrix.output{1}(6,6)];

  end



We can then compare the classification accuracies for Faces against that of Houses, for example; or that of Faces versus Scissors:
::

  %%% Example t-tests %%%
  [F_H_h, F_H_p, F_H_ci, F_H_stats] = ttest(Group_Results_Face, Group_Results_House);
  [F_S_h, F_S_p, F_S_ci, F_S_stats] = ttest(Group_Results_Face, Group_Results_Scissors);
  
In the first case (Faces compared to Houses), the average classification accuracy within this ROI is virtually identical - the resulting t-test is not significant. The comparison of Faces against Scissors, on the other hand, yields a t-statistic of 5.80, p<0.001, representing a significant difference between the two.


Group Analysis: Searchlight
***************************

The group analysis of the searchlight results requires more steps. Remember that our preprocessing pipeline did not include normalization, since we wanted to introduce as few interpolations as possible; this also enabled us to use subject-specific masks for our ROI group analysis.

Our searchlight maps, located within the ``SPM_Results`` directories, will instead need to be normalized before they can be used in a group analysis. To do this, open SPM, and then open the Batch editor. Select ``BasicIO -> File/Dir Operations -> File Operations -> Named File Selector``. Set the Input Name to "Anatomicals", and create 6 File Sets. Select each subject's realigned anatomical image for the corresponding File Set, and then create a Segmentation Module by selecting ``SPM -> Spatial -> Segment``. Highlight the ``Volumes`` field and click ``Dependency``, selecting all of the images from the Named File Selector. In the ``Save Bias Corrected``, change the selection from ``None`` to ``Save Bias Corrected``. At the very bottom of the window, change ``Deformation Fields`` to ``Forward``, and then click the Green Go button. This will only take a minute or two.

When it has finished, go back to the SPM GUI and select ``Normalise -> Write``. Create 6 new Subject fields, and select the corresponding deformation field in the ``anat`` directory and the ``res_accuracy_minus_chance.nii`` image for each subject in their results folder. Click ``Done``, and then click the Green Go button. The normalized classification map for each subject, which now has a ``w`` prepended to it, can be overlaid on an MNI template of your choosing to make sure that it was normalized properly. You may also choose to smooth these normalized results in order to make the assumptions of the t-test more valid; to do this, click on ``Smooth`` and select the normalized images in each subject's folder.

From the Matlab terminal, create a new directory by typing ``mkdir 2ndLevel_GroupResults``. Then click on ``Specify 2nd-Level`` and select this new directory in the ``Directory`` field. Double-click on the ``Scans`` field, and select all of the smoothed and normalized accuracy maps; then, click on the ``Estimate`` button and estimate the model. When this is finished, click on ``Results``. Just as with the fMRI studies, you can create a single contrast weight to determine where the classification accuracy is above chance. In this example we will use a voxel-wise threshold of p=0.001 and a cluster threshold of 50; see the link below for a guide to cluster correction if you want to fine-tune this. Notice that the results are strongest in the ventral temporal and occipital areas, similar to the results reported in the original Haxby paper.

.. note::

  For a whole-brain analysis of accuracy minus chance, the assumptions of a t-test may not hold completely; a paper `by Allefeld and colleagues <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916303470?casa_token=8EXUWXo8eusAAAAA:IYSVKKmJyzFfvv8ylKZiXaaKaGAFBKLFy45WYUwU5Ue4XHVq44eXU4T4LyEp_YJnL7xjTrqy>`__ found that another method called **prevalence testing** may be more appropriate. In our case, this method may not be sensitive enough to work with only six subjects, but we will explore other approaches in future chapters.

Next Steps
**********

Now that you have learned the basics of MVPA from preprocessing to group analysis, you are ready to use The Decoding Toolbox on a dataset of your choice. In the next chapters, we will review other features of The Decoding Toolbox, such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA).
