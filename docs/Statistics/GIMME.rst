GIMME (Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation)
==============


Overview
*********

GIMME is a statistical software package that is run on the platform `R <https://www.r-project.org/>`__. It uses a network analysis approach to analyze longitudinal data at both relatively short and long timescales, from seconds to days. GIMME can also be used with neuroimaging data to outline the temporal dynamics of different nodes within a brain network. This allows the user to create a more sophisticated framework of how different brain regions interact with each other under certain conditions.


.. (Give an example here? Use the "emotional contagion" example from the Beltz & Gates 2017 paper?)


Requirements
*********

In order to use GIMME you will have to first install R and then download the required packages. For an overview of R and how to install packages, see the following videos:
